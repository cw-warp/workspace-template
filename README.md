# Workspace Template

This repository contains the template for initializing a new workspace with `warp init` command.

Each branch is dedicated to a specific chain, if the chain has special requirements.

In contrast, the 'main' branch of the repo contains a `generic` template that mtches chains that do not require extra config and support CosmWasm version 2.0 at minimum.
